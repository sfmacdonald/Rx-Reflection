# Rx-Reflection
Application for patients to track medications

# Description

This application allows any user who needs to track medications they take or have taken in the past to maintain a profile with their medications in it. The user will create a profile featuring a username and password to protect their personal medication information. The user can enter information about their prescription such as dose, reason for use, route, and more to fine tune it to their needs. This application will use node.js and Express.js, creating a RESTful API, as well as Handlebars.js for the template engine. In addition to these, it will feature GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data. 

# User Story

As a patient prescribed medications, I need the ability to track which ones I take by name (brand or generic), how often (days of the week, times per day), the route (oral vs injection) and if there are any contradictions. I also need the ability to track medications that have been discontinued (when and reason) so that if a physician needs to know past medical history, I may provide it to them.
